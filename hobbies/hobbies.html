				<h2>Knitting</h2>
			
				<p>I like to <b>knit.</b> My Oma taught me when I was very little, and I've liked it ever since.</p>
				
				<p>I mostly knit clothes (sweaters, socks, etc.), but occasionally I'll make a blanket or a sweatshirt.</p>
				
				<p>Click <a href="knitting/knitting.html">here</a> for some images of knitting projects I have completed in the past.

				<h2>Reading</h2>
			
				<p>I also like to <b>read.</b> I learned to read at 4 years old and I've constantly had a book in my hand ever since.</p>
				
				<p>I usually like to read fantasy books, but occasionally I'll branch out into realistic fiction.</p>
